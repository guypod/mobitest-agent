Mobitest Agents are mobile apps that measure mobile web performance.

The Mobitest Agents act as mobile agents of a webpagetest (https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/private-instances) server.
They can (and should) be installed on real mobile devices, measure using the platform's embedded browser, and can measure over the network connection that device is using (e.g. WiFi, 3G).

Mobitest was originally written by Blaze (www.blaze.io). 
Blaze was acquired by Akamai (www.akamai.com) in Feb, 2012, which open-sourced Mobitest a month later (March, 2012).
NOTE: The applications are still called "Blaze", but they may get renamed in the future.

The hosted Mobitest, which uses the Mobitest Agents in the background, can be found here: http://mobitest.akamai.com/m/index.cgi

The Mobitest Agents also power the Mobile HTTP Archive (mobile.httparchive.org).
